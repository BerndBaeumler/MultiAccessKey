The main screen of maKey contains four windows. These windows are marked with red numbers in the screenshot above. For a multi-access key the content of these windows is:  
1. A tree with the available characters and intput fields to specify the character of the organism to be identified 
2. A list with the taxons witch are matching the characters specified above
3. Information about the currently selected character or taxon
4. A description of the characters related to the taxon that was last selected 

For a single-access key the content of these windows differs only slightly:  
1. A window with the current key options and the history of previously chosen options 
   - Every option is specified by a set of characters
   - An option may specify one or multiple taxons as result of the identification process
2. A list with the taxons covered by the single-access key
3. Information about the currently selected character or taxon
4. A description of the characters related to the taxon which is selected in the list of taxons
